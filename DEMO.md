# Scribble Demo

This directory contains demo materials to showcase Scribble's features.

## Quick Demo

To see Scribble in action, you can:

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

2. **Run the demo:**
   ```bash
   ./target/release/scribble demo_files/
   ```

3. **Try these features:**
   - Navigate through files with arrow keys
   - Press `Enter` to open a file and see syntax highlighting
   - Use `Ctrl+F` to search within files
   - Press `q` to quit

## Recording a Demo

We've included scripts to create demo recordings:

### Create an asciinema recording:
```bash
./create_demo.sh
```

This will create a `demo.cast` file that can be:
- Played back locally: `asciinema play demo.cast`
- Uploaded to asciinema.org for web sharing
- Embedded in documentation

## Demo Files

The `demo_files/` directory contains sample files that showcase:

- **`hello.rs`** - Rust syntax highlighting with functions and tests
- **`example.py`** - Python syntax highlighting with type hints and imports  
- **`notes.md`** - Markdown formatting with lists, headers, and checkboxes
